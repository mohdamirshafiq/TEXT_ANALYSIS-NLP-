# TEXT_ANALYSIS_NLP
- 20000+ of texts from articles analyzed for 5 categorization including 'tech', 'business', 'sport', 'entertainment', 'politics'.

## ABOUT THE PROJECT
The text documents comprised of 5 categories as mentioned before which are:
1. tech
2. business
3. sport
4. entertainment
5. politics

Therefore, the categorization of the text documents into those 5 categories conducted through Deep Learning in order to avoid waste of time and resouces.

## OBJECTIVE
1. Develop a deep learning model using LSTM which can achieve accuracy of more than 70% and F1 score of more than 0.7.
2. Use TensorFlow library to develop and train the model.
3. Plot the graph using Tensorboard.
